# Predictions_ST10010ZC11_vintage

The purpose of the these notebooks triplet is to make acoustic impedance prediction test by introducing ST10010ZC11 vintage seismic data which was used by Ravasi in his study.  
The workflow is shown in the related notebooks with the following objectives:
Volve 2011 reprocessed vintage ST10010ZC11:
Objective: to combine the partial new vintage seismic into one data set of the seismic cubes.

2. volve ST10010ZC11 vintage - well seismics
Objective: to combine well log data and the set of seimic cubes. The result is an organized file with the seismic data extracted along the well combined with the log data

3. Volve ST10010ZC11 vintage - training and predictions
Objective: to make predictions using the new dataset as input
